# mChat
## A lightweight, easy to use, modern chat to replace the default ROBLOX chat.

*To follow progress of mChat, check out my Trello board: https://trello.com/b/Z9U5O2pH/mchat.*

Feel free to use, redistribute, or modify the code here. All that I ask in return is for proper credit to be allocated and for it to not be sold to others. Thanks for understanding, and enjoy!

To install mChat, simply paste the following into your command bar in Studio **(Credit to Nevermore Engine by @Quenty and its contributers for the idea/concept of the installer.)**:
```lua
local ht = game:GetService("HttpService") local htp = ht.HttpEnabled ht.HttpEnabled = true loadstring(ht:GetAsync("https://cdn.rawgit.com/m0dulum/mChat/master/install.lua"))() ht.HttpEnabled = htp
```
